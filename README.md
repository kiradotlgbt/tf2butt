# tf2butt
tool to add buttplug.io support to TF2. written by an idiot, don't expect anything good

# installation

don't!

# current status
it isn't ready for public use, a lot of variables depend on my own specific installdir/steam username/hud config, so you'd have to change the hardcoded values and rebuild. i'll eventually hopefully rewrite it to add proper support for that stuff.

also, it currently freezes if u try to run it because i rewrote as a forms app, and i don't understand how that stuff works. i'll add background task stuff later too hopefully, so it actually works lol

but the (barely working) features include:

* detection of kills/deaths, followed by a Vibrationâ„¢
* detection of ubers using OCR (i didn't want to inject into the code or any vac risky shenanigans like that) that kinda doesnt rly work perfectly rn but somewhat works!!!!
* much more (this is what you write when you don't have any other features)
